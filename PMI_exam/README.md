# Methodology of programming  I. exam

You can use only and exclusively your personal, previously written codes. You cannot collaborate or communicate
with any other person on this exam, nor use anyone else's code in your solution.

## Tasks

0. (0 pont) Clone this repository and share it on your own GitHub account:
    - Code / Copy URL
    - File / New / Project from Version Control...
    - Git / GitHub / Share Project on GitHub
1. (2 points) Create a ***Matrix*** class. In ***Matrix*** create the ***indexOfFirstNonZero*** and the
   ***getMinimumOfRows*** methods. Both method has to process a 2-dimensional integer matrix: first one has to
   define the index of the first non-zero value, other one has to define the minimum of rows.
2. (4 points) Implement the ***Bank*** class, which handle bank accounts (account number, balance).
   The class should have an ***openNewAccount*** (add a new account with 0 balance), a ***closeAccount***
   (remove the given account), and a ***getBalances*** (return the details of actually stored account numbers and
   their balance as a String) method.
3. (2 points) Derive a ***MoneyTransfer*** class from the ***Bank*** class. ***MoneyTransfer*** class has to
   contain a ***transfer*** method, with which we can modify the balance of a ***Bank*** object.
